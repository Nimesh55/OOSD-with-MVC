The users of this application can obtain a ticket that is verified by the relevant authorities in a contactless manner by sending a request. another user type is the admin of a given institution. This user verifies that the essential service person works at the given institution. Public transit can be allocated depending on the number of service personnel on a given route. Another user type is the conductors of the relevant public transit. They can verify that a person who boards a transport service is allowed in that time by verifying the ticketing details. This can be extended to an online ticket verification method for any citizen to use public transit after the pandemic is over.
